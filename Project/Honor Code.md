# Important information
The grade of the project is 15/15. My individual grade is 15.78/15\
If there is same questions or project in the future, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes and report, or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository dosen't take any commitment for other's faults.\
The honor code policy of this course is very strict, Horst himself will check your cheating and copying of other's work, do not bet on your luck.\
There was a very $\color{red}{serious}$ incident happened in VE401  $\color{red}{SP2022}$.
I believe that, in SU2022, you have seen the quarrel，insulting and many many question boxes about that incident which made your Wechat moment and the public site “EXCITING” a mess, and almost all people in JI and even some students SJTU had known that  $\color{red}{rediculous}$ incident.\
We will not prevent you from knowing what happened that time. If you want to know detail, refer to the following document, written by the previous TA, a student in VE401 SP2022 who was involved in HC case because of his teammate, as well as a member of honor council.

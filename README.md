# Introduciton to This Repo
I am a JI student enrolled in 2020. And I was the TA of VC210 FA2021, VE203 SU2022, VV256 FA2022, FA2023, ECE4010J SP2023, STAT4510J FA2023. I was quite interested in statistics course like Bayesian Analysis(STAT4510J). The repo here is aimed to help students in JI to get higher grade in ECE4010J.\

# CTPP
This is the most important folder of this repo. In the folder ctpp: there is the ctpp that may help in midterm and final exam, which is based on the TA GJN in SP2021 and something is added by me and SP2023 TA CLT. Many of the complicated function like Variable Transformation, Linear Regression and Hypothesis Testing is realized by us. Run the code and you will directly get answer.
Hope you can get at least A- or A in this course (I think it is extremely easy)!
# Project
First refer to this repo https://github.com/wonderwind271/VE401_TA/blob/master/other%20related%20materials/something%20about%20VE401%20SP22%20project/circumstance.md
In the folder project: there is the python code for the term project in SU2022. My advice is that: do not try deep learning model in the project, since there is not enough data, deep learning model will definitly fit poorly. I guess that the project of following term will be different since there was a big HC issue in SP2022.
# Measure Theory
In the folder measure theory: there is the note I write down which is about simple measure theory its relationship with probability theory for your better understanding of the beginning lessons of this course. However, I can't promise that what I wrote in that file is completely right, there maybe typos.

# Variable Transformation
In that folder, the basic concept and code implementation on Pytorch of variational inference with normalizing flow is placed. It is an application of variable transformation learned in the course ECE4010J. There are a corresponding paper in 2016 about the variational inference with normalizing flow, the arxiv link is provided

# EM-Code
The example problem and the corresponding solution code to these problem using EM algorithm implemented by python. Which is a classical numerical method finding local minimum, which will be taught in detail in STAT4510J Bayesian Analyis.

# ECE4010J Honor Code  
If there is same questions or labs in the future, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes and reports, or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository dosen't take any commitment for other's faults.

# Introduciton to This Repo
I am a JI student enrolled in 2020. And I was the TA of VC210 FA2021, VE203 SU2022, VV256 FA2022. I was quite interested in applied math especially the probability theory(Bayesain Analysis) and linear algebra. For the sake of time, I may not be able to apply the TA's job of ECE4010J but I'd like to upload some file to help my friends in JI to get higher grade in this course.\
Updates: I will be TA of this course in SP2023
# Project
First refer to this repo https://github.com/wonderwind271/VE401_TA/blob/master/other%20related%20materials/something%20about%20VE401%20SP22%20project/circumstance.md
In the folder project: there is the python code for the term project. My advice is that: do not try deep learning model in the project, since there is not enough data, deep learning model will definitly fit poorly.
# Measure Theory
In the folder measure theory: there is the note I write down which is about simple measure theory its relationship with probability theory, if you have interest you can read this. However, I can't promise that what I wrote in that file is completely right.
# Variable Transformation
In that folder, the basic concept and code implementation on Pytorch of variational inference with normalizing flow is placed. It is an application of variable transformation learned in the course ECE4010J. There are a corresponding paper in 2016 about the variational inference with normalizing flow, the arxiv link is provided
# EM-Code
The example problem and the corresponding solution code to these problem using EM algorithm implemented by python. Which is a classical numerical method finding local minimum, which will be taught in detail in STAT4510J Bayesian Analyis.
# CTPP
In the folder ctpp: there is the ctpp that may help in midterm and final exam, which is based on the TA GJN in SP2021 and something is added by me.
Hope you can get at least A- or A in this course!
# ECE4010J Honor Code  
If there is same questions or labs in the future, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes and reports, or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository dosen't take any commitment for other's faults.
